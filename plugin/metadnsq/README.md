# dnssrc

*dnssrc* - a CoreDNS forwarding/proxy plugin with the main function of triaging based on client sources

This plugin is based on the `github.com/leiless/dnsredir` extension, many thanks to `dnsredir ` for the inspiration

Most of the configurations are similar except for the client-based source address changes

# Example

    . { 
        # Read address list fileï¼ŒOne IP address or CIDR per line
        dnssrc locals.conf {
            expire 30s
            path_reload 3s
            max_fails 0
            health_check 5s
